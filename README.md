Observable trends in data: 

1. The temp/lat plot shows a fairly standard parabola showing that temperatures are hottest at 
latitudes near the equator. 

2. The number of plots on the temp/lat curve show that there are far more cities in northern 
latitudes than in southern latitudes. This makes sense given the amount of ocean between 
the southern coasts of Asia, South America, Africa, and Australia and the northern coast of 
Antarctica. Note that I attempted to address the randomization issue by moving the 
southernmost limit pretty far north. 

3. The humidity/lat plot shows some level of crowding near the equator, showing that 
equatorial latitudes tend to be more humid. But, there's a pretty good range in northern lattitudes 
as well. 

4. Neither cloudiness/lat plot or the wind/lat plot point to any significant conclusions.
